Project Tailwind Footer

## Project Overview

This project focuses on developing a responsive footer for a web page using Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework. Tailwind's responsive design features and utility classes allow for efficient styling of web components. This exercise is designed to strengthen your understanding of CSS fundamentals, responsive design principles, and the practical application of Tailwind CSS. 



## Learning Reflections

Throughout this project I understood the concept of utility-first CSS, which involves using small, single-purpose utility classes to style elements rather than writing custom CSS rules. This approach streamlined development and allowed for rapid prototyping. One of the main challenges I encountered was not being able to understand syntax and all, but I was able to overcome it by continuous edge of searching online for understanding.

Overall, working on this project has been quiet a great experience and educating. I feel more confident in css tailwinds and boodstrap, and I'm excited to continue learning and growing as a developer.
